# Blob api authentication examples

Code mostly comes from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/quickstart-blobs-javascript-browser

`parcel index.html` to serve page

There is another example in the `ms-identity-javascript-v2` folder, that I couldn't get to read from blob storage, but it could get the details of the current user, and read emails and things like that. It is from a microsoft example repo, and has its own readme.

I got the blob api working with msal v1 and msal v2, but not with adal (there is another repo with the adal example).
